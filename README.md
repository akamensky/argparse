Let's be honest -- Go's standard command line arguments parser `flag` terribly sucks. 
It cannot come anywhere close to the Python's `argparse` module. This is why this project exists.

The goal of this project is to bring ease of use and flexibility of `argparse` to Go. 
Which is where the name of this package comes from.

# This is v2 version of library, for v1 see branch v1

#### Installation

To install and start using argparse simply do:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/akamensky/argparse/v2
```

You are good to go to write your first command line tool!
See Usage and Examples sections for information how you can use it

If you have any improvements to offer, please open an issue first to ensure this improvement is discussed.

There are following tasks to be done:
* TODO

However, note that the logic outlined in method comments must be preserved 
as the library must stick with backward compatibility promise!

#### Acknowledgments

Thanks to Python developers for making a great `argparse` which inspired this package to match for greatness of Go
